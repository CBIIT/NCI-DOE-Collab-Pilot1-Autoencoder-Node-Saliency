# NCI-DOE-Collab-Pilot1-Autoencoder-Node-Saliency

### Description:
The purpose of this software is to explain the learned tasks in autoencoders. This is done by ranking hidden nodes in the latent layer of the autoencoder according to their capability of performing a learning task.

### User Community: 
Experienced data scientists interested in understanding the mechanism of dimensionality reduction using autoencoder. 

### Usability:  
The repo contains two examples of preprocessed data and the scripts that process these examples. The two examples use data from the popular public image classification datasets (MNIST), and preprocessed data from Genomics Data Common breast cancer cases.

### Uniqueness: 
The novelty of this method is discussed in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320318304369?via%3Dihub)

### Components: 
* Preprocessed data sets in the git hub 
* Python scripts to use the method

### Technical Details:
